# Octoprint-3D Printer Extras (Osminog)

**Note** This is a work in progress!  Currently this project is still
mostly in the planning phase.

I have a 3D printer managed by Octoprint in my basement and would rather
that I be able to turn on/off the fan and LED lighting supporting
that printer programmatically via Octoprint's events API.

What this provides is a USB device allowing me to:

* Turn the power outlet supporting the LED lighting and 3D printer
  off or on.
* Switch DC power to a LED lighting strip.
* Gather temperature and humidity measurements.
* Control a strip of addressable RGB LEDs. (Planned)
* Beep upon completion.  (Planned)
